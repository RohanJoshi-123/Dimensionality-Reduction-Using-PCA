# Dimensionality-Reduction-Using-PCA

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates Dimensionality Reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The objective is to reduce high-dimensional data into fewer dimensions while preserving maximum variance and important information.

Dimensionality reduction helps improve:
- Model performance
- Training speed
- Data visualization
- Overfitting reduction

This project was developed as part of my Data Science Internship Program.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand high-dimensional data
- Implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Reduce features while retaining maximum variance
- Visualize transformed data
- Compare original vs reduced dataset

## 🧠 What is PCA?
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical technique used to transform correlated features into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables called Principal Components.

Key concepts:
- Variance maximization
- Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors
- Feature transformation
- Explained variance ratio
